## FLAGGER

## Intro:
Welcome to the world of Flagger! In this game, your main focus is to jump across platforms to reach the flag and claim it
as your own! Do you have what it takes to survive obstacles and make it up top? Play and see if you can become the next 
Flagger!

## Description:
The game will have some random functions that will change the positions of the platforms and the enemies each time the
player starts the game. The game will also be using classes to use inheritance for certain paramaters like points and 
velocity. The application, ARCADE, will play a huge part in this project as it will be using platform physics and give
the player the physics of gravity and how it will vary based on the user inputs.

## Wish List:
Function/Class that will show the time (either a count down or duration of time).
Enemies will be different based on the random function (fire, spike, etc.)
Make the gravity change at times (short jumps or long jumps)
Background music


## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. 
Open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by 
running the following command.
```
 root
 +-- random_runner
    +--game
        player       (information holder) "Holds the information of the player playing."
        constants    (informatin holder) "Holds variable info for the game."   
        
    +--__init__.py
    +--__main__.py
+--README.md

```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE 
and open the project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and 
click the "run" icon.
